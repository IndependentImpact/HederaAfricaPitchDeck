## Problem / Opportunity

* Africa has a rapidly growing population with a significant portion of young people. 

* Africa has many economic, social and ecological challenges.

*  **The people are not the problem, they are the solution!**

* Emerging technology like the Hedera network provides opportunity to empower and mobilise this massive human capital for beneficial action on large scale. 

## Independent Impact

Independent Impact is developing a radically open platform for reporting, quantifying, and verifying human impact with transparency, community oversight, and verifiable technology.

## 

The platform is designed with solid philosophical, conceptual and technical foundations evolve and sustain in the long term:

## Philosophy 

### **Open but meritocratic**

Participation is open to individual and legal entities as implementers, validators, verifiers, and methodology developers. Reputation, earned through quality contributions and peer evaluation, governs what actions each participant can take.

* Visible reputation for creators and reviewers 
* Peer evaluation at every stage 
* Incentives for continual quality improvements 

## Philosophy 

### **Transparent, not prescriptive**

Independent Impact is designed so users can clearly interpret every quantified outcome while choosing the metrics, assurance levels, and estimation approaches that meet their needs.

* Flexible impact metrics 
* Clear disclosure of methodologies 
* User-driven assurance requirements

## Philosophy 

### **Immutable yet accessible**

Proven distributed technologies protect artefacts and transactions while making every action auditable. Users can interrogate projects, credentials, and impact claims in depth.

* Immutable artefact storage 
* Fast, fair and immutable event ordering
* Queryable history of actions, controls and artefacts

<!--
**Radically open** means that anyone can join and participate and that participation can take place at many levels. This must include:

 - unemployed youth in a village 
 - entrepreneurs 
 - small and large NGOs 
 - governments 
 - corporations 
 
**Radically open** means there are no mediators for participation, but that *what* can be done depends on the reputation gained through quality participation  

### Transparency and Reputation

**Transparency** builds trust when all events are fairly ordered, visible and discoverable

Everything has **reputation** and every action has consequences. This mean the system evolves towards better quality.  -->

## Conceptual Framework

Long terms sustainability flows from an elegant but comprehensive conceptual framework

### Core ontology

Independent Impact is built on a fundamental ontology: **Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO)**.

\n\n
The AIAO and its related ontologies provide a comprehensive framework for defining and quantifying human impact on the environment and society. 

___ 

The core Independent Impact team was instrumental in developing the AIAO and related ontologies.

[AIAO](https://w3id.org/aiao) 

[Impact Ontology](https://w3id.org/impactont) 

[Claim Ontology](https://w3id.org/claimont) 

[Information Comminication Ontology](https://w3id.org/infocomm)


## Conceptual Framework

### Everything is semantic

Discoverablity and interoperability are built in from the start by using semantic web standards. 

<!-- RDF, OWL, SHACL, and SPARQL. -->

## Technology

### Long terms sustainability flows from an elegant and efficient technology architecture

## Product

##  Market Size

## Target Customer

### Traditional tokenised outcomes
